// Linear Search Algorithm//


step1:Start
step2:set i to 1
step3:if i>n, then jump to step8
step4:if A[i] = X then jump to step7
step5:set i to i+1
step6:goto step3
step7:prinnt elemrnt X found at index i and jump to step9
step8:print element not found
step9: stop

Begin
Loop for i=0 to arr_len-1 with increment i by 1
if a[i] =number)then
print number
else print not found
Exit
